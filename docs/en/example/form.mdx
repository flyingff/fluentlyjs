# Forms

Forms are something everyone will use, it's very normal.

What we need is to use the simplest possible means to achieve these annoying form/class form requirements.


## Traditional Forms

It looks like a form at first glance. A typical CRUD scenario.

## Modern Presentation

Although it doesn't look like a traditional form interface, its interaction form, data flow, etc. are the same as traditional forms. The model built above doesn't need to be changed at all, and most of the business logic can be directly reused, taking a step towards the goal of "maximizing reuse".
