# What is Fluently.js

It is a library that organizes program structure from the perspective of data flow, and it is also a programming mindset oriented towards human thinking.

## What problems can it solve

The goal of `fluently.js` is to reduce cognitive load by using a predictable, composable, and extensible data flow programming model, thereby improving code maintainability.

The design goals of `fluently.js` include but are not limited to solving problems in the following scenarios:

- Data flow management in web applications, including internal data flow management within the client and data flow management between the client and the server
- Data flow management in server-side applications, including data processing, data transmission, etc.
- Organization of steps such as moving, transforming, and processing "General Data" in professional applications

## Features

- **Data Flow Programming Model**: The core of `fluently.js` is the data flow programming model. By refining core concepts, it allows developers to focus on logical expression without worrying about the details of data flow.
- **Declarative**: `fluently.js` is a declarative framework. Through its design philosophy, it keeps developers away from complex issues such as timing, synchronization, and asynchrony.
- **Ease of Use**: The design goal of `fluently.js` is ease of use. It customizes standard best practices for common operations, allowing developers to quickly "brainstorm".
- **Extensible**: The modules of `fluently.js` are composable. Complex functions can be achieved through simple combinations, and third-party plugins can be installed to extend functionality.
- **Ecosystem Friendly**: `fluently.js` is a framework focused on data solutions. It can work in collaboration with other frameworks, libraries, and tools, such as `React`, `Vue`, and other view frameworks.
- **Future-Oriented**: The API design of `fluently.js` takes into account support for high-productivity tools such as AI tools and low-code tools, helping developers better meet future challenges.
